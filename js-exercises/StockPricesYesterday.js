//Writing programming interview questions hasn't made me rich. Maybe trading Apple stocks will.
//Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:
//
//The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
//    The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
//    So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.
//
//Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.
//
//    For example:
//
//    var stockPricesYesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];
//
//getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday);
//// returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
//
//No "shorting"ï¿½you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).

var stockPricesYesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];

console.log(getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday));
// returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

function getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday) {
    var lowestPrice = stockPricesYesterday[0];
    var highestPrice = stockPricesYesterday[0];

    // iterate through array
    for (var i = 1; i < stockPricesYesterday.length; i++) {
        // get lowest stock price
        if (stockPricesYesterday[i] < lowestPrice) {
            lowestPrice = stockPricesYesterday[i];
        } else {
            // get highest stock price
            if (stockPricesYesterday[i] > highestPrice) {
                highestPrice = stockPricesYesterday[i];
            }
        }
    }

    return (highestPrice - lowestPrice);
}
